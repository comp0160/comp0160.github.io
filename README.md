# COMP0160 Perception & Interfaces

This page is currently a placeholder, but will eventually host course materials for the
[Perception & Interfaces](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/perception-and-interfaces-COMP0160)
module at [UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/), for delivery in
Term 2 (January-March 2023).

While the content is currently similar, this `README.md` file should now be decoupled from
the index page of the published [GitHub Pages site](https://comp0160.github.io/).
