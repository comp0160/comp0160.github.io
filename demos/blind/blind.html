<h1>Blind Spot Demos</h1>

<p>The <b>optic disc blind spot</b> is the region of each retina where the optic
nerve passes out of the eye <i>en route</i> to the <b>optic chiasm</b>. In this
region there are no photoreceptors, and hence no visual information. But
the brain quietly fills in this absence so that it is almost never noticeable.</p>

<h2>1. Existence</h2>

<p>This first demo will (hopefully) enable you to <i>observe</i> the
existence of this blind spot, as the filled in visual information
fails to contain an object that you <i>know</i> is there.</p>

<p>Close one eye and look at the letter corresponding to the open eye
— ie, on the opposite side of the visual field to that eye — in the box
below. Adjust your head position until the other letter disappears —
this should be when your eye is about 3 times further away from the
screen than the distance between the letters. You may or may not find
it helpful to tilt your head slightly away from horizontal in the
direction you are looking.</p>

<h2>2. Sneakiness</h2>

<p>In this second demo, you are presented with a similar setup, but
the stimulus on each side is more complex, and it's continuous with the
surrounding region. In this case you will likely not really be able to
see the blind spot, even though the information from that region is
still not being received. The brain is able to interpolate the content
based on the information it is receiving from the neighbouring areas.</p>

<p>Once again, close one eye and look with the other towards the
centre of the circle on the opposite side of the box. Adjust your head
position until the centre of the other circle is in your blind spot.
This may be slightly trickier than before, but you should still be
able to find a position where you are <i>aware</i> that the centre is sort of
<i>not there</i>, but there will probably not be any noticeable gap in
the converging lines.</p>
