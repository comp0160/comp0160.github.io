This page is currently a placeholder, but will eventually host course materials for the
[Perception & Interfaces](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/perception-and-interfaces-COMP0160)
module at [UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/), for delivery in
Term 2 (January-March 2023).

Also, while the content is currently similar, this index page should
now be decoupled from the `README.md` of the site's
[GitHub repository]({{ site.github.repository_url }}).
