This page hosts some additional course materials for the
[Perception & Interfaces](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/module-catalogue/modules/perception-and-interfaces-COMP0160)
module at [UCL Computer Science](https://www.ucl.ac.uk/computer-science/).
For the main body of course materials, please see the
[Moodle page](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=41697).

## Practical Lab Sessions

The pages below contain information and links to online experiments for the first
four weeks of Thursday morning practicals.

* Week 1 (16 Jan 2025): [Psychophysics](lab1.html)

<!--
* Week 2 (18 Jan 2024): [Colour & Contrast](lab2.html)
* Week 3 (25 Jan 2024): [Auditory Perception](lab3.html)
* Week 4 (01 Feb 2024): [Data & Tactility](lab4.html)


Briefings for weeks 5-10 are (or will be) on
[Moodle](https://moodle.ucl.ac.uk/course/view.php?id=33682#module-4778462).

For these sessions we will make use of the [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/download).
**Please install this before Lab 5**. The suggested Unity version is 2019.4.34f1
[[Windows](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/6a9faed444f2/UnityDownloadAssistant-2019.4.34f1.exe),
[Mac](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/6a9faed444f2/UnityDownloadAssistant-2019.4.34f1.dmg)],
but in practice more recent versions also seem to work fine. Do not be intimidated by
Unity's licensing structure -- the free personal version is sufficient, and you do not
need to install any additional "build support" modules.

The lab content is provided in custom Unity packages, which can be
[downloaded here](https://github.com/davidswapp/CD_ratios/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

Some additional Unity code developed in later sessions may be found in the
[Unity](https://github.com/comp0160/unity) repository.
