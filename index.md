<!--
For these sessions we will make use of the [Unity game engine](https://unity.com/download).
**Please install this before Lab 5**. The suggested Unity version is 2019.4.34f1
[[Windows](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/6a9faed444f2/UnityDownloadAssistant-2019.4.34f1.exe),
[Mac](https://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/6a9faed444f2/UnityDownloadAssistant-2019.4.34f1.dmg)],
but in practice more recent versions also seem to work fine. Do not be intimidated by
Unity's licensing structure -- the free personal version is sufficient, and you do not
need to install any additional "build support" modules.

The lab content is provided in custom Unity packages, which can be
[downloaded here](https://github.com/davidswapp/CD_ratios/archive/refs/heads/main.zip).

<!--
Some additional Unity code developed in later sessions may be found in the
[Unity](https://github.com/comp0160/unity) repository.
