# Lab Session 2: Colour & Contrast

As part of this lab you will act as a test subject in a number of simple
visual psychophysics experiments. The experiments run in your web browser.

**Privacy note**: You will be given the opportunity to download your results in CSV format.
Your data is not otherwise stored or used in any way except for local presentation to you.

## Experiments

Not all of these are strictly *experiments* — in the sense of collecting
data — but they will hopefully be useful illustrations of some of the
concepts discussed in the visual perception lecture.

* [Assessing legibility of colour combinations](experiments/legibility/?home=/lab2.html)

## Colour Tools for UI & Visualisation

These are handy when you're doing UI design or visualisation
work, to help guide your colour choices, but they're also interesting
to play with in their own right to get a better understanding of
the parameters of colour vision. It can be quite illuminating to just
poke around these tools and see what they tell you.

* [Color Oracle](http://colororacle.org): a tool for simulating different
  colour vision deficiencies. Runs locally, free download for Mac, Windows
  & Linux, with source code available.
* [Sim Daltonism](https://michelf.ca/projects/sim-daltonism/): another
  colour blindness simulator, free & open source for Mac and iOS.
* [ColorBrewer](https://colorbrewer2.org/#type=qualitative&scheme=Paired&n=4):
  web-based tool for choosing among the very widely used palettes devised by
  [Cynthia Brewer](https://sites.psu.edu/cbrewer/). Originally produced for
  cartographic use, these palettes have been hugely influential. They are
  probably already available in your plotting software of choice.
* [i want hue](https://medialab.github.io/iwanthue/): cute web-based tool for
  creating colour palettes for visualisation by optimising a randomised
  population under various constraints. Colour blindness is one of those
  constraints, though you have to explicitly choose it.
* [viz palette](https://projects.susielu.com/viz-palette): web-based tool for
  *testing* colour palettes for visualisation. Includes colour deficiency
  simulations. You need to get the colours from somewhere else, but they're
  easy to import.



## Rogues' Gallery

I was going to include some examples of terrible visualisation, but
honestly you should just spend 10 minutes scrolling through the
[Data Is Ugly](https://www.reddit.com/r/dataisugly/) subreddit instead.

* [Yvette's](https://yvettesbridalformal.p1r8.net) might be the worst
  web page you've ever seen, but how is its accessibility?
<!-- * Or perhaps [Arngren's](https://arngren.net) is the worst? -->
* But in many ways [this page](https://www.mavencluster.com/blog/12-common-ui-ux-designing-mistakes/)
  may actually be worse. Why?
  

## Discussion Points

Here are some things to think about while doing the activities,
and also when looking through the data download afterwards. There will be
opportunities during the session to discuss these and any other points that
may occur to you.

* What is the experience of doing the experiment like? Did you learn anything from it?
* What is the experiment attempting to measure, and is it successful in doing so?
* Are there any obvious flaws in the experimental setups?
* What data is collected?
* Is there any other data that you think would be helpful to collect?
* What kinds of analyses might you perform with this data, and what would they reveal?
